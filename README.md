# challenge_10_Team_profile_generator

This is a JavaScript source-code for a Team Profile Generator using object-oriented programming concept. The app is a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each member. Apart from the HTML page, testing of source code is key to making code maintainable,  4 unit tests have been written for each employee classes used in the code. All 4 unit tests have run and passed proving the validity of the classes and its object methods.

The app will be using Inquirer package of NPM as dependency and then the Jest package for testing the code. The app will be invoked by using the following command:

    “node index.js”


The completed JavaScript source-code, employee classes, testing code and package log (ie package.json file) are available in the following GitHub repo as Main branch,

A sample Team page html file generated for demo purpose is available in the GitHub repo as follows to demonstrate performance of the tool, named as “team.html” and “style.css”.

Brief description

The app is built using object-oriented programming concept and running in Node.js runtime environment. It makes use of command-line input to raise 3 groups of questions regarding the team manager, its team engineers and interns.  After entering information about a member, user is taken to the main menu to add the next member or decide to finish team building and generate the product html file.
Apart from the HTML page, testing of source code is key to making code maintainable,  4 unit tests have been written for each employee classes used in the code. All 4 unit tests have run and passed proving the validity of the classes and its object methods.

Acceptance criteria

The application will meet the following criteria expected by an app developer,

-	The tool can generate a webpage that displays a team's basic info so that we have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles

-	When prompted for the team members and their information, an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

-	When clicking on an email address in the HTML, then the default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

-	When clicking on the GitHub username, that GitHub profile opens in a new tab, the user is prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

-	When entering the manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number,  I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building the team


-	When selecting the engineer option, I’m prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

-	When selecting the intern option, I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

-	When decided to finish building the team, then I exit the application, and the relevant HTML file is generated
